            <p class="main">We will use the test data set of mango leaf disease
            https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/mango-leaf-disease-dataset
            The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a subtype of Neural Networks that is mainly used for
            applications in image and speech recognition. Here I implementing the Convolutional Neural Network
            using python. Here, I build an classifier for mango leaf diseases using CNN model.
            CNN Model:
            A convolutional neural network (CNN) is an subset of the machine learning. It is one of the various
            types of artificial neural networks which are used for the different applications and data types. CNN is
            a network architecture for the deep learning and it is specially used for image recognition and tasks
            involved in processing the data pixel.

               <!-- <h2 class="main"><b><u>Naïve Bayes Algorithm:</u></b></h2> -->
               <p class="main">CNN layers:
                CNN consists of three layers: convolutional layer, pooling layer and fully connected layer. In every cnn
                model it starts with the convolutional layer and ends with the fully connected layer. From the
                convolutional layer to fully connected layer, the complexity of the CNN increases. It helps us to identify
                the larger portions and complex features of an image until it identifies an object.
                <br>Convolutional layer : It is an core building block of an CNN, the majority of computations occurred in
                the convolutional layer. The process of an convolution involves a kernel or filter inside this layer. In this
                layer image is converted into the numerical values, which allows the CNN model to interpet the image
                and extract relevant patterns from it.
                <br>Pooling layer:
                It is similar to the Convolutional layer, It’s also sweeps an kernel or filter across the input image. But
                here, the pooling layer reduces the parameters in the input and results in some information loss. But
                this layer reduces the complexity and improve the efficiency of the CNN.
                <br>Fully connected layer:
                This is where image classification happens in the CNN model based on the extracted features from the
                previous layers.
                </p>
                <h2 class="main"><b><u>Working principle of CNN Model::</u></b></h2>
               <p class="main">A CNN can have the multiple layers, where each of them helps us to detect the different features of an
                input image. A filter or kernel will be applied to each image to produce an output which helps to get
                progressively better and more detailed after every layer.
                At the each successive layer, the filters will increases its complexity to check and identify features that
                will help us to represent the input object. The output of the each image from the every layer will
                become the input to the next layer and the last layer, which is FC layer which helps the CNN to
                recognizes the images or the object it represents.
                The Applications of Convolutional neural network are Healthcare, Social media, Automotive, Facial
                recognition</p>

                <p class="main">The first step will be importing the libraries which are the basic libraries such as numpy, pandas, cv
                    and os. These are the most important things for any machine learning model. </p>

                <p class="main">To better understand of the data. The dataset has been downloaded from kaggle which consists of
                    approximately 4,000 images. Upon loading the data from the drive we learn that the data consists of
                    8 classes</p>

                1.I have gone through to references to understand how to implement code using keras and sklearn
                modules. Then, I build my cnn model.
                <br>2.The main challenge, I was faced is finding the best hypermeters for model tuning to improve my
                model performance. Where, I tried building my model using various hypermeters parameters to get
                better accuracy score
                <br>3.I have attached the training and validation graphs of my model.</p>
