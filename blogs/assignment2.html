            <p class="main">We will use the test data set of rotten tomato review
                https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/rotten-tomatoes-reviews
                 
                In machine learning algorithms, naïve bayes classification is a straight forward and powerful 
                algorithm for classification task. Here I implementing the naïve bayes classification using 
                python. Here, I build an naïve bayes classifier to predicting whether the review is rotten or 
                fresh.
                </p>
            
               <h2 class="main"><b><u>Naïve Bayes Algorithm:</u></b></h2>
               <p class="main">It is a classification technique based on bayes theorem with an independence assumption 
                among predictors. Naïve Bayes classification is based on applying Bayes theorem with strong 
                independence assumption between the features. Naïve Bayes classification produces good 
                results when we use it for textual data analysis such as Natural Language Processing.Naïve 
                Bayes classifier applies the Bayes’ theorem in practice. This classifier brings the power of Bayes’ 
                theorem to machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2 class="main"><b><u>Naïve Bayes algorithm intuition:</u></b></h2>
               <p class="main">Naïve bayes classifier uses the bayes theorem to predict the membership probabilities of each 
                class such as probability of given data belongs to a particular class. The class with highest 
                probability will considered as most likely class.
                Here, naïve bayes classifier assumes that all the features are unrelated to each other. Presence 
                or absence of a feature will not effect or influence the presence or absence of any another feature.
                In real world datasets, we test a hypothesis given multiple evidence on features. So, the 
                calculations become quite complicated.</p>
                <h2 class="main"><b><u>Types of Naïve Bayes Algorithm:</u></b></h2>
                <h3 class="main">Gaussian Naïve Bayes algorithm:</h3>
                <p class="main">When we have continuous attribute values, we made an assumption that the values 
                    associated with each class are distributed according to Gaussian or Normal distribution</p>
                <h3 class="main">Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm:</h3>
                <p class="main">Multinomial Naïve Bayes model, samples represent the frequencies with which certain events 
                    have been generated by a multinomial where pi is the probability that event i occurs. 
                    Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm is preferred to use on data that is multinomially distributed. 
                    It is used in text categorization classification.</p>
                <h3 class="main">Bernoulli Naïve Bayes algorithm:</h3>
                <p class="main">This model is also popular for document classification tasks where binary term occurrence 
                    features are used rather than term frequencies.
                    The applications of the naïve bayes algorithm is the text classification and sentiment analysis.</p>
                
                <h2 class="main">Import Libraries</h2>
                <p class="main">The first step will be importing the libraries which are the basic libraries such as numpy, pandas 
                    and re. These are the most important things for any machine learning model.</p>

               <h2 class="main">Import dataset</h2>
               <p class="main">We need to import the data set using the read_csv function. where it will helps us to load the 
                csv files</p>
                <img src="assignment2/2.PNG" alt="">
                <h2 class="main">Exploratory data analysis</h2>
                <p class="main">To better understand of the data. We use some functions such as info(),value_counts(), isnull()
                    and head(). Which will helps to understand the dataset in a better way</p>
               <img src="assignment2/3.PNG" alt="">
               <h2 class="main">Encoding</h2>
               <p class="main">In this stage we are going to remove the unwanted data. It is a process of removing the 
                commoner morphological and inflexional endings from words in English. We need to perform 
                this before we are going to build a model. Here we remove the stop_words, other than 
                alphabets and numbers to perform a model.</p>
